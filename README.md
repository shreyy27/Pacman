Pacman
What is the Game?
Pacman is a classic arcade game where the player controls a character (Pacman) navigating through a maze, eating dots while avoiding four ghosts. The objective is to clear all the dots in the maze without being caught by the ghosts. The game is known for its simple yet addictive mechanics and strategic gameplay.

How to Play the Game:
1.	Player Control: The player uses arrow keys to move Pacman in four directions (up, down, left, right) through the maze.
2.	Objective: Pacman needs to eat all the dots while avoiding the ghosts that roam the maze.
3.	Win Condition: The player wins by clearing all the dots from the maze.
4.	Lose Condition: The game ends if Pacman is caught by a ghost.

Data Structure Used in the Game:

1.	Graph Data Structure:
-	The maze in Pacman is often represented using a graph where each node represents an intersection or a turn in the maze, and edges represent the possible paths between these nodes.
-	This allows efficient navigation through the maze, ensuring Pacman and the ghosts follow valid paths without crossing walls.
